# newcodez

I created this file to log the random Katas I solve on codewars.com. I am attemping to do atleast one Kata per day to keep my skills up while continuing to learn in the process. If you happen to stuble accross this page, I want to let you know there is a lot of room for improvement in my solutions, so please don't judge me too hard! 

If you want to reach out to me for any reason, please feel free to do so! I appreciate any feedback you might have.
